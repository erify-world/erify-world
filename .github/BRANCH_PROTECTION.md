- **Write**: Core contributors, team members
- **Triage**: Community moderators, issue managers
- **Read**: External contributors, community members

## üöÄ Workflow Requirements

### Pull Request Template

Every PR must include:

- [ ] **Purpose**: Clear description of changes
- [ ] **Testing**: Evidence of testing (screenshots, logs)
- [ ] **Documentation**: Updated docs if needed
- [ ] **Breaking Changes**: Clearly marked and explained
- [ ] **Performance Impact**: Benchmark results if applicable

### Required Checks

#### 1. Code Quality

```yaml
name: 'Code Quality'
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
  - name: 'Format Check'
    run: npm run format:check
  - name: 'Lint Check'
    run: npm run lint
  - name: 'Type Check'
    run: npm run type-check
```

#### 2. Security Scanning

```yaml
name: 'Security Scan'
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
  - name: 'CodeQL Analysis'
    uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v3
  - name: 'Dependency Scan'
    run: npm audit
```

#### 3. Performance Testing

```yaml
name: 'Performance Test'
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
  - name: 'Lighthouse CI'
    run: npm run lighthouse:ci
  - name: 'Bundle Size Check'
    run: npm run bundle:analyze
```

#### 4. Accessibility Compliance

```yaml
name: 'Accessibility Check'
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
  - name: 'WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance'
    run: npm run a11y:test
  - name: 'Color Contrast Check'
    run: npm run contrast:check
```

## üîê Security Policies

### Sensitive File Protection

Files requiring additional security review:

- `package.json` (dependency changes)
- `.github/workflows/*.yml` (CI/CD modifications)
- Security configurations
- Environment variable files

### Vulnerability Response

1. **Critical**: Immediate hotfix to `main` (bypass normal flow)
2. **High**: Priority PR with expedited review
3. **Medium/Low**: Normal development flow

## üìä Compliance Monitoring

### Automated Enforcement

- **Commit message format**: Conventional Commits via commitlint
- **Code style**: Prettier pre-commit hooks
- **Security**: Automated dependency scanning
- **Performance**: Bundle size limits enforcement

### Manual Review Points

- Architecture changes requiring design review
- New third-party dependencies
- Changes affecting user data handling
- Performance-critical modifications

## üé® ERIFY‚Ñ¢ Specific Standards

### Luxury-Grade Requirements

All code must meet ERIFY‚Ñ¢'s luxury standards:

- **Performance**: Sub-second load times
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA minimum
- **Mobile Experience**: Perfect responsive design
- **Browser Support**: Latest 2 major versions
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript strict mode, 90%+ test coverage

### Brand Compliance

- Use approved ERIFY‚Ñ¢ color palette
- Follow typography guidelines
- Implement smooth, luxury-grade animations
- Maintain consistent component naming

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Hotfix Process

1. Create `hotfix/critical-issue-description` branch from `main`
2. Implement minimal fix with thorough testing
3. Create PR with `[HOTFIX]` label
4. Require 1 admin approval (expedited review)
5. Deploy immediately after merge
6. Create follow-up issue for comprehensive fix

### Rollback Process

1. Identify problematic commit/PR
2. Create `rollback/revert-description` branch
3. Use `git revert` for safe rollback
4. Deploy rollback immediately
5. Investigate root cause and create fix plan
